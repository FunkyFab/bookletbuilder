A Java program to build PDF booklet out of images and/or one-page PDFs
As a trombone player, in a marching band, I need a score booklet, in order to be able to read them on my Kobo tablet.
The best way to do so is to have them all in a single PDF.
But when a new piece is added, or the order of the scores is changed, it's a nightmare to recreate the booklet PDF.
So I decided to write my own software for writing booklet PDFs.
